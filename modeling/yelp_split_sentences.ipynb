        "Brick and Mortar has been bookmarked for a long time, but due to the absurd amount of good restaurants in St Pete it took a while to get here...Big Mistake on our part as even in a great dining town like St Pete this one is a real standout...Located directly across Central from Cycle Brewing it takes up the bottom floor of an office building..the restaurant is not a big place, but when crowded they have a separate \"room\" they seat people in which is actually the lobby of the office building during business hours...I know the add on room sounds terrible, but that's where we sat and the extra space was actually quite nice...Brick and Mortar definitely has the hot concept in the restaurant business these days which is small plates with a drink menu specializing in Wine and Local Craft Beers...St Pete/Tampa Area has a lot of these type places, but Brick and Mortar does it better than most...went with a group of six who all like to order small plates and share so I was able to sample many dishes that included..Carpaccio with House Ravioli stuffed with a Poached Egg...Veal Meatballs over Creamy Parmesan Polenta...Slow Braised Octopus done 2 different ways...Curry and Spice Rubbed Smoked Pulled Pork Poutine..Carmelized Onion and Cheese Tart... and a Charred Romaine Heart....not a misfire was to be found in any of the six dishes with The Poutine Dish being my favorite...I like Poutine so much that The Canadians are close to making me a Honorary Citizen so I tend to order it the rare times I see it on menus...Brick and Mortars may be the best I ever had as it consisted of Truffle Fries covered with Red Curry Gravy..Smoked Pulled Pork..Queso Fresco...Pickled Onions..Cilantro..and Jalapeno...this dish just exploded with flavor...do yourself a favor if you go to Brick and Mortar and order this dish and you won't be sorry...besides the food they also had a fantastic wine and local craft beer selection and I was excited to be able to get a Cycle Cream and Sugar Please which is not available much outside the brewery..server was on point with good recommendations and was always there when we needed her...it was also a nice touch that the owner came by a few times to ask us how we were doing and how we enjoyed everything?..it's easy to see why everything is so good at Brick and Mortar and why it runs so smoothly when the owner is around and obviously cares so much..in a town full of great Restaurants Brick and Mortar is one of the best and I will definitely return sooner than later..this one rates an easy 5 stars on every Restaurant Measurable and deserves all it's success\n",
